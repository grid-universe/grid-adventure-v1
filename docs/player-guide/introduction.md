Welcome to Grid Adventure V1 Player Guide.

Grid Adventure V1 is a flexible, grid‑based game in which you implement an agent that interacts with diverse gameplay mechanics to fulfil objectives.

The world is represented as a 2D grid made up of tiles. The agent can start at any location in the grid and must work towards collecting any gems, and reaching the escape tile.

* [Objectives](objectives.md) — what you must accomplish to complete a level
* [Movements](movements.md) — how the Agent moves and interacts with various objects
