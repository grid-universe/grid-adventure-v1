## Powerup-Speed

Speed allows the agent to move 2 tiles in 1 turn. It lasts for 5 turns.

The demo shows the agent movement once boots are picked up. Note that walls can still restrict the agent from moving 2 tiles. After 5 turns, the agent exhausts the powerup and returns to 1 tile per turn.

## Powerup-Shield

Shield allows the agent to move through lava without taking damage. It has 5 uses.

In this demo, the agent health has been set to 1, so landing on lava will result in a loss. Thus, the agent collects the shield powerup to pass through 3 lava tiles and reach the exit.
